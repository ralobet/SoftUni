                    W3C is pleased to announce the selection of Web Science Institute at
                    the University of Southampton, to host UK & Ireland Office. The W3C United Kingdom
                    and Ireland Office will be staffed by Susan Davies, Coordination Manager for the WSI,
                    who will become the Office Manager, and Professor Leslie Carr, Director of the WSI Centre
                    for Doctoral Training, who will act in a Senior Advisor role. W3C Offices act as local points
                    of contact for W3C work and help ensure that W3C and its specifications reach an
                    international audience. Professor Dame Wendy Hall, Executive Director of the WSI commented,
                    “The WSI is excited to be taking on this important role within the W3C. The University of
                    Southampton has played an active role in the Web community since 1994 and has been a member of
                    the W3C since 1998, promoting new futures of the Web through W3C community groups including the
                    Web Observatory, Annotations and Web of Things.
